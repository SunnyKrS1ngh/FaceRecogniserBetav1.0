# FaceRecogniserBetav1.0
clone the repo.

while training put the required images in known_faces. And the faces which needs to be detected put in unknown_faces.

while training resize images to 500 x height in jpeg format. If you want to detect faces in a group it is advisable to have hd image for testing (1920x_ will do) then resize it
to 700x_ .

The algorithm can detect more than 7 faces if it is provided high-res image and is given high-end cpu for computation.
